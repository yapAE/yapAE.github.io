Since the 17th century , Yap was a Spanish colony and, in 1898, was sold to Germany to become a major German naval communication center before the First World War. At the end of World War II, Yap was occupied by the U.S. military victors until 1986 when it became part of an the independent nation of the Federated States of Micronesia.\n\nYap is known for its stone money, named Rai or Fei. These are large doughnut-shaped carved disks of limestone ranging in size from 3.5 cm to 4 m in diameter. The disks were brought from Palau, and their value is based on the stone’s size and history. Rai are placed in front of meeting houses or along pathways known as the “money banks” and attested the status and power of their owners. They were used for a variety of social “transactions,” from marriage gifts to political payoffs.\n\nThere was a distinct feature for this currency. Upon concluding a bargain which involves the price of a Rai that is too large to be physically moved, the new owner accepts the bare acknowledgement of ownership and a simple mark on the stone to indicate the exchange, leaving the Rai at the former owner’s premises. Yap does not have a centralized bank that document ownership of stones, but relies on every single member of the tribe to keep track of who owns which stone; hence, the tribe becomes a distributed ledger. If at any point, a member tries to change ownership, he would not be able to do that without the consent of all tribe members. The monetary system is based on a universal agreement among the Yapese about the distributed wealth without the need to transport their assets; in this case the Rai. This system is the basis of the current blockchain technology.\n\nADDRESS 1\nOffice : G11\nFloor : Ground 0\nBuilding : Building 02\nDubai Knowledge Park\n\n","source":"about/index.md","raw":"title: About\n---\n# YAP Centre For BlockChain Studies, Dubai\nProfile: \nVision: The YAP Centre For Blockchain Studies(Dubai) is a center of excellence aiming to be the globally leading institution that understands, creates, and realizes blockchain-based solutions in a cross-industry and cross-disciplinary private-public partnership, generating value for current and future generations, exploring the challenges of the future, and converting them into opportunities for sustainable development.\n\nMission: The YAP Centre For Blockchain Studies(Dubai) is a think tank and research center which investigates implications of blockchain technology for companies and their business models.

BlockChain Studies, Dubai</h1><p>Profile:<br>Vision: The YAP Centre For Blockchain Studies(Dubai) is a center of excellence aiming to be the globally leading institution that understands, creates, and realizes blockchain-based solutions in a cross-industry and cross-disciplinary private-public partnership, generating value for current and future generations, exploring the challenges of the future, and converting them into opportunities for sustainable development.</p>\n<p>Mission: The YAP Centre For Blockchain Studies(Dubai) is a think tank and research center which investigates implications of blockchain technology for companies and their business models. Besides the development of prototypes, it serves as a platform for managers, start-ups, technology, government,and industry experts to share knowledge and best practices. YAP Centre also provides new research impulses and develops trainings for students and executives. It seeks to position Dubai as the leading knowledge and research hub in the field of blockchain.</p>\n<p>FAQ:</p>\n<p>What is blockchain?</p>\n<p>Blockchain is a robust technology that stores identical blocks of information across its network. It cannot be controlled by a single party and does not have a single point of failure. Blockchain uses encryption technology and decentralised data storage which minimise hacking risks and improve security.</p>\n<p>What is YAP?</p>\n<p>Yap is an island located in the Caroline Islands in Micronesia. Since the 17th century , Yap was a Spanish colony and, in 1898, was sold to Germany to become a major German naval communication center before the First World War. At the end of World War II, Yap was occupied by the U.S. military victors until 1986 when it became part of an the independent nation of the Federated States of Micronesia.</p>\n<p>Yap is known for its stone money, named Rai or Fei. These are large doughnut-shaped carved disks of limestone ranging in size from 3.5 cm to 4 m in diameter. The disks were brought from Palau, and their value is based on the stone’s size and history. Rai are placed in front of meeting houses or along pathways known as the “money banks” and attested the status and power of their owners. They were used for a variety of social “transactions,” from marriage gifts to political payoffs.</p>\n<p>There was a distinct feature for this currency. Upon concluding a bargain which involves the price of a Rai that is too large to be physically moved, the new owner accepts the bare acknowledgement of ownership and a simple mark on the stone to indicate the exchange, leaving the Rai at the former owner’s premises. Yap does not have a centralized bank that document ownership of stones, but relies on every single member of the tribe to keep track of who owns which stone; hence, the tribe becomes a distributed ledger. If at any point, a member tries to change ownership, he would not be able to do that without the consent of all tribe members. The monetary system is based on a universal agreement among the Yapese about the distributed wealth without the need to transport their assets; in this case the Rai. This system is the basis of the current blockchain technology.</p>\n<p>ADDRESS 1<br>Office : G11<br>Floor : Ground 0<br>Building : Building 02<br>Dubai Knowledge Park</p>\n"},{"title":"Functions","_content":"## Functions\n   The YAP Centre For Blockchain Studies(Dubai)’ functions will concentrate on three areas: blockchain technologies, conventional economics industries, and Islamic economics transactions.

blockchain technologies, conventional economics industries, and Islamic economics transactions. In each one of these three businesses, three main endeavors will be tackled: scientific research, capacity building, and consultancy. These nine tasks will be geared to meet the needs of government, investors, research institutes, banking, finance, insurance, legal firms, startups, tech corporation, consultancy, the creative economy, healthcare, tourism, supply chains, and more.<br>The functions can be divided into three categories. These are:</p>\n<h3 id=\"First-Scientific-Research-Innovative-Solutions\"><a href=\"#First-Scientific-Research-Innovative-Solutions\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"First: Scientific Research (Innovative Solutions)\"></a>First: Scientific Research (Innovative Solutions)</h3><p> Delivering practical applications and revealing the technology’s potential for business and government leaders, industry practitioners, and startups.<br> Creating a hub for innovation driven by blockchain technology and cross-discipline<br> collaboration, that can occur at the intersections of diverse academic studies and research.<br> Focusing on scientific and technological substances: distributed network, scalability,<br> cryptography, cybercrime, technology of smart contracts, and elaboration of a blockchain<br> protocol suite.<br> Tackling economic and financial themes: herding and irrational behaviors, new sources of risk,<br> market distortions, cryptofinance, social inequality and financial inclusion, community<br> information and decision-making, and smart contracts.<br> Developing regulations and laws: regulatory (un)certainty, digital consumer protection laws,<br> digital identification, institutional development, elaboration of industry best practice standards,<br> and laws of smart contracts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Second-Training-and-Education-Capacity-Building\"><a href=\"#Second-Training-and-Education-Capacity-Building\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Second: Training and Education (Capacity Building)\"></a>Second: Training and Education (Capacity Building)</h3><p> Establishing a space for blockchain education and training.<br> Blockchain Summer and/or winter School.<br> Providing students in UAE universities with the tools to become fluent in blockchain technology<br> and distributed application development.<br> Fostering a culture that routinely analyzes the revolutionary ways in which blockchain<br> technology impacts society.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Third-Consultancy-Think-Tank\"><a href=\"#Third-Consultancy-Think-Tank\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Third: Consultancy (Think-Tank)\"></a>Third: Consultancy (Think-Tank)</h3><p> Blockchain for government and diplomacy.<br> Blockchain for national security objectives.<br> Blockchain to fundamentally change the way organizations transact with their customers.<br> Exploring the use of blockchain and cognitive technologies to improve business transactions across several different industries.<br> Engagement with regulators and public administrations.<br> Engagement with the startup community.<br> Establishing a Blockchain Startup Observatory that will gather and promote blockchain<br> initiatives, acting as an incubator, accelerator, and platform of connections.<br><img src=\"/images/201805/functions-01.png\" alt=\"functions\"><br><img src=\"/images/201805/functions-02.png\" alt=\"functions\"></p>\n"},{"title":"Introduction","_content":"## What is blockchain?\n### Introduction\nA blockchain is a constantly growing list of records, or blocks, which are connected and\nsecured using cryptography. Each record contains timestamps and transaction data which are resistant to modification, thus enabling a blockchain to record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent manner. Essentially, it is a distributed and public digital ledger used to record transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the collusion of the network. Blockchains are secure by design; they exhibit high interactive consistency and decentralization. By storing data across its network, the blockchain eliminates the risks that come with data being held centrally. These features make blockchain especially suitable for recording of events, medical\nrecords, transaction processing, documenting food traceability, chronology of ownership, and so on.\n## Why must blockchain be studied?\nBlockchain technology in the information age represents the critical intersection between the\nfinancial rails, social networking, and powerful decentralized networks. It is critical for stakeholders to formulate careful legal and business strategies around novel business models as the technology and infrastructure, as well as the corresponding market appetite and regulatory structures, evolve\nrapidly in disparate global markets.\nBlockchain technology is on the move around the world. It is, therefore, essential that we better understand this cutting-edge technology, as it becomes more ubiquitous in our economy. Today, as we consider this far-reaching technology and its potential applications across all sectors, we should have a couple of goals in mind. Blockchain has the potential to become a powerful tool in the hands of citizens and social innovators. In particular, governments can benefit from distributed ledger technologies in terms of data privacy, citizens’ rights, ethic boundaries, digital sovereignty, and community governance. Emerging technologies offer both opportunities and challenges that needs\nto be analyzed from a political and administrative point of view.\n## Why Dubai?\nThe Dubai Blockchain Strategy establishes a roadmap for the introduction of blockchain technology for Dubai and the creation of an open platform to share the technology with cities across the globe. It is developed and executed in partnership with the Dubai Future Foundation, the leading independent research organization that will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of Dubai in light of the Dubai Future Agenda adopted by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. By 2020, the emirate wants all visa applications, bill payments, and license renewals to be transacted digitally using blockchain.\nTo realize our goal of becoming a globally leading institution that understands, creates, and achieves blockchain-based solutions, it is essential that we are located within an environment that nurtures innovation and promotes partnerships and collaborations. Dubai has pledged long-term commitment to building a bright and prosperous future. To achieve this, the emirate has become a global hub that attracts the world’s brightest minds, explores the challenges of the future, and converts them into opportunities for sustainable development. We aim to embody Dubai’s approach in placing future-readiness at the core as we become a leading global research hub that focuses on the future applications of blockchain, generates new knowledge, and prepares current and future\ngenerations for its uses.\n\n## Why include Islamic economics in Blockchain?\nAfter surveying the research centers around the world, it has become evident that none of them integrated an Islamic economics approach to their scope of work. It is important to note that Islamic economics is unique in nature, and explicitly integrating it within a research approach to blockchain will provide us with new and innovative perspective to the technology. Thus, YAP Centre will be filling a gap in the market, in a world where there is a growing demand for Islamic economics perspectives to be incorporated into the newest of technologies and innovative economic transactions. Moreover, the fact that YAP Centre is situated and established in Dubai, the World Capital of Islamic Economics, inspires us to focus on an Islamic economics perspective, and utilize the passion for Islamic economics that is found in the city. We strongly believe that Dubai should lead the introduction and integration of Islamic economics within the cutting-edge technology of blockchain, into the growing financial as well as industrial sectors. We must also take into consideration the Halal food industry and trade that is thriving in the world today. Explicitly including Islamic economics within our scope will give YAP Centre a leading and unique role in the world of blockchain as well as the sectors related to Islamic finance and industry.\n","source":"docs/index.md","raw":"title: Introduction\n---\n## What is blockchain?\n### Introduction\nA blockchain is a constantly growing list of records, or blocks, which are connected and\nsecured using cryptography.

In particular, governments can benefit from distributed ledger technologies in terms of data privacy, citizens’ rights, ethic boundaries, digital sovereignty, and community governance. Emerging technologies offer both opportunities and challenges that needs<br>to be analyzed from a political and administrative point of view.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Why-Dubai\"><a href=\"#Why-Dubai\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Why Dubai?\"></a>Why Dubai?</h2><p>The Dubai Blockchain Strategy establishes a roadmap for the introduction of blockchain technology for Dubai and the creation of an open platform to share the technology with cities across the globe. It is developed and executed in partnership with the Dubai Future Foundation, the leading independent research organization that will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of Dubai in light of the Dubai Future Agenda adopted by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. By 2020, the emirate wants all visa applications, bill payments, and license renewals to be transacted digitally using blockchain.<br>To realize our goal of becoming a globally leading institution that understands, creates, and achieves blockchain-based solutions, it is essential that we are located within an environment that nurtures innovation and promotes partnerships and collaborations. Dubai has pledged long-term commitment to building a bright and prosperous future. To achieve this, the emirate has become a global hub that attracts the world’s brightest minds, explores the challenges of the future, and converts them into opportunities for sustainable development. We aim to embody Dubai’s approach in placing future-readiness at the core as we become a leading global research hub that focuses on the future applications of blockchain, generates new knowledge, and prepares current and future<br>generations for its uses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Why-include-Islamic-economics-in-Blockchain\"><a href=\"#Why-include-Islamic-economics-in-Blockchain\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Why include Islamic economics in Blockchain?\"></a>Why include Islamic economics in Blockchain?</h2><p>After surveying the research centers around the world, it has become evident that none of them integrated an Islamic economics approach to their scope of work. It is important to note that Islamic economics is unique in nature, and explicitly integrating it within a research approach to blockchain will provide us with new and innovative perspective to the technology. Thus, YAP Centre will be filling a gap in the market, in a world where there is a growing demand for Islamic economics perspectives to be incorporated into the newest of technologies and innovative economic transactions. Moreover, the fact that YAP Centre is situated and established in Dubai, the World Capital of Islamic Economics, inspires us to focus on an Islamic economics perspective, and utilize the passion for Islamic economics that is found in the city. We strongly believe that Dubai should lead the introduction and integration of Islamic economics within the cutting-edge technology of blockchain, into the growing financial as well as industrial sectors. We must also take into consideration the Halal food industry and trade that is thriving in the world today. Explicitly including Islamic economics within our scope will give YAP Centre a leading and unique role in the world of blockchain as well as the sectors related to Islamic finance and industry.</p>\n","site":{"data":{"languages":{"en":"English"},"menu":{"about":"/docs/summary.html","research":"/docs/","advising":"/advising/","activities":"/advising/","conference":"/docs/","resources":"/docs/","publications":"/projects/"},"sidebar":{"docs":{"executive_summary":{"summary":"summary.html","introduction":"index.html","profile":"profile.html"},"functions":{"functions":"functions.html"}},"projects":{"projects":{"projects":"index.html"}},"docs_bak":{"getting_started":{"overview":"index.html","setup":"setup.html","configuration":"configuration.html","commands":"commands.html","migration":"migration.html"},"basic_usage":{"writing":"writing.html","front_matter":"front-matter.html","tag_plugins":"tag-plugins.html","asset_folders":"asset-folders.html","data_files":"data-files.html","server":"server.html","generating":"generating.html","deployment":"deployment.html"},"customization":{"permalinks":"permalinks.html","themes":"themes.html","templates":"templates.html","variables":"variables.html","helpers":"helpers.html","internationalization":"internationalization.html","plugins":"plugins.html"},"miscellaneous":{"troubleshooting":"troubleshooting.html","contributing":"contributing.html"}},"api":{"core":{"overview":"index.html","events":"events.html","locals":"locals.html","router":"router.html","box":"box.html","rendering":"rendering.html","posts":"posts.html","scaffolds":"scaffolds.html","themes":"themes.html"},"extensions":{"console":"console.html","deployer":"deployer.html","filter":"filter.html","generator":"generator.html","helper":"helper.html","migrator":"migrator.html","processor":"processor.html","renderer":"renderer.html","tag":"tag.html"}}},"plugins":[{"name":"hexo-filter-mermaid-diagrams","description":"mermaid diagrams for Hexo.","link":"https://github.com/webappdevelp/hexo-filter-mermaid-diagrams","tags":["filter","mermaid","chart","diagrams"]},{"name":"hexo-lazyload","description":"lazyload images support for Hexo with IntersectionObserver API.","link":"https://github.com/Robin-front/hexo-lazyload","tags":["lazyload","images","performance","IntersectionObserver"]},{"name":"hexo-deployer-cos","description":"Tencent Cloud Object Storage (COS) plugin of Hexo.","link":"https://github.com/sdlzhd/hexo-deployer-cos","tags":["official","deployer","cos"]},{"name":"hexo-tag-cplayer","description":"A hexo plugin for cPlayer.","link":"https://github.com/EYHN/hexo-tag-cplayer","tags":["cplayer","music","audio"]},{"name":"hexo-lazyload-image","description":"lazyload images support for Hexo.","link":"https://github.com/Troy-Yang/hexo-lazyload-image","tags":["lazyload","images","performance"]},{"name":"hexo-include-markdown","description":"This plugin for Hexo can easily load markdown files in Markdown.","link":"https://github.com/tea3/hexo-include-markdown","tags":["markdown","import","include","partial","load","template"]},{"name":"hexo-asset-pipeline","description":"A hexo plugin to minify/optimize HTML, CSS, JS and images.

class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Introduction\"></a>Introduction</h3><p>A blockchain is a constantly growing list of records, or blocks, which are connected and<br>secured using cryptography. Each record contains timestamps and transaction data which are resistant to modification, thus enabling a blockchain to record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent manner. Essentially, it is a distributed and public digital ledger used to record transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the collusion of the network. Blockchains are secure by design; they exhibit high interactive consistency and decentralization. By storing data across its network, the blockchain eliminates the risks that come with data being held centrally. These features make blockchain especially suitable for recording of events, medical<br>records, transaction processing, documenting food traceability, chronology of ownership, and so on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Why-must-blockchain-be-studied\"><a href=\"#Why-must-blockchain-be-studied\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Why must blockchain be studied?\"></a>Why must blockchain be studied?</h2><p>Blockchain technology in the information age represents the critical intersection between the<br>financial rails, social networking, and powerful decentralized networks. It is critical for stakeholders to formulate careful legal and business strategies around novel business models as the technology and infrastructure, as well as the corresponding market appetite and regulatory structures, evolve<br>rapidly in disparate global markets.<br>Blockchain technology is on the move around the world. It is, therefore, essential that we better understand this cutting-edge technology, as it becomes more ubiquitous in our economy. Today, as we consider this far-reaching technology and its potential applications across all sectors, we should have a couple of goals in mind. Blockchain has the potential to become a powerful tool in the hands of citizens and social innovators. In particular, governments can benefit from distributed ledger technologies in terms of data privacy, citizens’ rights, ethic boundaries, digital sovereignty, and community governance. Emerging technologies offer both opportunities and challenges that needs<br>to be analyzed from a political and administrative point of view.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Why-Dubai\"><a href=\"#Why-Dubai\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Why Dubai?\"></a>Why Dubai?</h2><p>The Dubai Blockchain Strategy establishes a roadmap for the introduction of blockchain technology for Dubai and the creation of an open platform to share the technology with cities across the globe. It is developed and executed in partnership with the Dubai Future Foundation, the leading independent research organization that will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of Dubai in light of the Dubai Future Agenda adopted by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. By 2020, the emirate wants all visa applications, bill payments, and license renewals to be transacted digitally using blockchain.<br>To realize our goal of becoming a globally leading institution that understands, creates, and achieves blockchain-based solutions, it is essential that we are located within an environment that nurtures innovation and promotes partnerships and collaborations. Dubai has pledged long-term commitment to building a bright and prosperous future. To achieve this, the emirate has become a global hub that attracts the world’s brightest minds, explores the challenges of the future, and converts them into opportunities for sustainable development. We aim to embody Dubai’s approach in placing future-readiness at the core as we become a leading global research hub that focuses on the future applications of blockchain, generates new knowledge, and prepares current and future<br>generations for its uses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Why-include-Islamic-economics-in-Blockchain\"><a href=\"#Why-include-Islamic-economics-in-Blockchain\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Why include Islamic economics in Blockchain?\"></a>Why include Islamic economics in Blockchain?</h2><p>After surveying the research centers around the world, it has become evident that none of them integrated an Islamic economics approach to their scope of work. It is important to note that Islamic economics is unique in nature, and explicitly integrating it within a research approach to blockchain will provide us with new and innovative perspective to the technology. Thus, YAP Centre will be filling a gap in the market, in a world where there is a growing demand for Islamic economics perspectives to be incorporated into the newest of technologies and innovative economic transactions. Moreover, the fact that YAP Centre is situated and established in Dubai, the World Capital of Islamic Economics, inspires us to focus on an Islamic economics perspective, and utilize the passion for Islamic economics that is found in the city. We strongly believe that Dubai should lead the introduction and integration of Islamic economics within the cutting-edge technology of blockchain, into the growing financial as well as industrial sectors. We must also take into consideration the Halal food industry and trade that is thriving in the world today. Explicitly including Islamic economics within our scope will give YAP Centre a leading and unique role in the world of blockchain as well as the sectors related to Islamic finance and industry.</p>\n"},{"title":"Profile","_content":"\n# YAP Centre Profile\nWe are a neutral think tank providing research, training, and consultancy services to industry members, dedicated knowledge-transfer activities, and in-house cutting-edge solutions.

id=\"Summary\"><a href=\"#Summary\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Summary\"></a>Summary</h2><p>   Dubai YAP Centre for BlockChain Studies is a independent think-tank and research center licensed and recognized by Dubai Creative Clusters Authority,  UAE and having address: G11, Block 2, Dubai Knowledge Park, Dubai, UAE. Its research, consultancy and training programs concentrate on three areas: blockchain technologies, conventional economics industries, and social impact. In each one of these three businesses, three main endeavors will be tackled: scientific research, capacity building, and advisory. These nine tasks will be geared to meet the needs of government, investors, research institutes, banking, finance, insurance, legal firms, startups, tech corporation, consultancy, the creative economy, healthcare, tourism, supply chains.<br>In light of the Dubai Future Agenda established by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Dubai announced its intention to turn itself into the first blockchain-powered government in the world by 2020. These ambitions are part of Dubai’s goal of becoming a global business hub with next-generation technology playing a key role in delivering this vision. The Dubai government also created the Global Blockchain Council with a specific focus on potential applications of blockchain technology, with the goal of highlighting how this technology could impact domestic financial and non-financial business sectors.<br>It is against this backdrop that we present ourselves as a neutral blockchain think tank providing research, training, and consultancy services to industry members, dedicated knowledge-transfer activities, and in-house cutting-edge solutions. We will work closely with several Dubai entities including trade, industry, tourism, education, health, as well as financial institutions and a vibrant startup community. In addition to this, we will be a base to deploy this new technology throughout the region.<br>The YAP Centre For Blockchain Studies(Dubai)’ (YAP Centre) functions will concentrate on three areas: blockchain technologies, conventional economics industries, and Islamic economics transactions. In each one of these three businesses, three main endeavors will be tackled: scientific research, capacity building, and consultancy. These nine tasks will be geared to meet the needs of government, investors, research institutes, banking, finance, insurance, legal firms, startups, tech corporation, consultancy, the creative economy, healthcare, tourism, supply chains, and more.<br>The first projects for the institute will focus on questions that were raised by Dubai’s vision of being the blockchain world center and the futuristic pioneer in the field. We will start with three distinct projects that represent the main fields of work for the institute:<br>• Research: Studying the potential of blockchain-based applications in different areas of society (government, finance, healthcare, etc.).<br>• Education: Summer and/or winter school program in blockchain. The Canadian University in Dubai will be the potential partner.<br>• Community: Multilateral Innovation Platform, designed around the industry and policymakers’ needs. An international conference on blockchain regulations that will bring together policymakers and world class experts in Dubai as a Capital of Islamic Economy.<br>We are driven by the spirit of Dubai as the lighthouse of the Muslim World in our endeavor to establish a center that brings the best of the East and the West, China, the Islamic world, and beyond. The YAP Centre For Blockchain Studies(Dubai) will be the first blockchain non-profit think tank.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/201805/summary.png\" alt=\"summary\"></p>\n"},{"title":"Projects","_content":"## Projects\nThe first projects for the YAP Centre For Blockchain Studies(Dubai) will focus on questions that were raised by Dubai’s vision of being the blockchain world center and the futuristic pioneer in the field.

We will start with three distinct projects that represent the main fields of work for the center:</p>\n<h3 id=\"Research-Studying-the-potential-of-blockchain-based-applications-in-different-areas-of-society-government-finance-healthcare-etc\"><a href=\"#Research-Studying-the-potential-of-blockchain-based-applications-in-different-areas-of-society-government-finance-healthcare-etc\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Research: Studying the potential of blockchain-based applications in different areas of society (government, finance, healthcare, etc.)\"></a>Research: Studying the potential of blockchain-based applications in different areas of society (government, finance, healthcare, etc.)</h3><p>Examples:<br> “End-to-end blockchain powered remittance services.”<br> “Laws and regulations governing blockchain technology.”<br> “Establishing a digital currency exchange (DCE).”</p>\n<h3 id=\"Education-Summer-and-or-winter-school-program-in-blockchain\"><a href=\"#Education-Summer-and-or-winter-school-program-in-blockchain\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Education: Summer and/or winter school program in blockchain.\"></a>Education: Summer and/or winter school program in blockchain.</h3><p>Example:</p>\n<h3 id=\"Community-Multilateral-Innovation-Platform-designed-around-the-industry-and-policymakers’-needs\"><a href=\"#Community-Multilateral-Innovation-Platform-designed-around-the-industry-and-policymakers’-needs\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Community: Multilateral Innovation Platform, designed around the industry and policymakers’ needs.\"></a>Community: Multilateral Innovation Platform, designed around the industry and policymakers’ needs.</h3><p>Example:<br> An international conference on blockchain regulations that will bring together<br> policymakers and world class experts in Dubai as a Capital of Islamic Economy.</p>\n"}],"Post":[{"title":"Best Practices in World-Class Centers","_content":"## Best Practices in World-Class Centers\nIn order to maximize our excellence, it is vital to learn from the experiences of other centers around the world. After extensively researching the different centers worldwide, we have concluded that there are three main centers that are renowned for their excellence and rigor in producing research on blockchain technology. These centers were chosen based on criteria that focused, firstly, on the universities and institutes that the centers are connected to, ensuring that only the highest ranking universities and institutes are considered. Thus, the UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies, and the MIT Digital Currency Initiative were chosen mainly because they are connected to world-class universities amongst the highest in world rankings. MIT is ranked as the top university in the world, and UCL is ranked 16thworldwide. The second criterion is the quality of the research produced, where all three centers were compared to other centers worldwide based on the research they publish and what was concluded was that these centers produced research of high quality, and have been running research projects for a longer time than other centers. Lastly, the final criterion is the relevance the centers have to the context of Dubai and to the goals and aims of YAP Centre. The IBM Center for Blockchain Innovation is relevant to the context of Dubai, as it has established collaborations with government authorities within Singapore, which is an essential aspect of the functioning of YAP Centre in Dubai. The research and collaboration examples provided by the 3 centers are a source of inspiration for YAP Centre, and provide a great example of best practices around the world.\nThis section will provide summaries of the top 3 centers that we have found to provide inspiration for our institute. Examples of research produced by the centers will also be included, to illustrate the relevance and rigor of their research.\n### UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies (CBT) – London, UK\nEstablished in the prestigious campus of University College London (UCL), this center combines knowledge from 8 different departments within the university, including Mathematics, Psychology, and Law. This unique combination ensures that their research draws upon a diverse set of knowledge, acknowledging the complexity and multi-layered nature of blockchain technology. In addition to their research, they provide advisory services and engagement with various stakeholders, including regulators and the startup community. Moreover, the center has various partners within different industries, as a way to foster innovation and collaboration in order to achieve cutting-edge solutions. The following are two examples of their research projects and research papers:\n\n1. RSCoin: This is a research project aimed at developed a cryptocurrency framework, which allows central banks to maintain full control over the monetary supply, as a way to prevent double-spending. What makes RSCoin unique is that it provides strong transparency and auditability, while maintaining a certain level of centralization\n2. Partnerships, Information and Public Safety: Community Policing in A Time of Terror: this research paper was authored by Christel Penella de Silva in 2017. The project aims to develop new methods and applications in space-time analytics and emergent network complexity, in order to uncover patterning and interactions in crime, policing and citizen perceptions.\n\n### IBM Center for Blockchain Innovation – Singapore\nThis center is part of the larger IBM Research group, working in collaboration with three different government authorities in Singapore, including the Port Authority of Singapore, the Economic Development Board, and the Monetary Authority of Singapore. The focus of the center is to develop new applications and solutions utilizing blockchain technology. The work with government\nauthorities ensures that adoption of blockchain is accelerated within different areas of trade and finance. The center aims to make Singapore a global center of industry leadership in blockchain and cognitive technologies.\n\n### MIT Digital Currency Initiative – Massachusetts, USA\nThis center is part of the larger MIT Media Lab, an interdisciplinary research laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The main mission of the group is to research cryptocurrency and the underlying technology, namely blockchain technology. Moreover, the research also explores the benefits, risks, and ethical considerations associated with blockchain technology. In addition to research, the MIT Digital Currency Initiative aims to support open-source cryptocurrency communities, while also fostering a diverse academic community in the field. Research from the center includes the following:\n1. Blockchain Applications to Solar Panel Energy: Landscape Analysis. This research project addresses the energy needs of developing countries by providing a blockchain-enabled, collateralized solar micro-grid solution. The blockchain technology is used to record data, transfer energy and regulate digital-currency payments within the villages that were part of the project.\n2. Blockchain: Digitally Rebuilding the Real Estate Industry by Avi Spielman (2016). This research paper explores the application of blockchain technology in the real estate industry. This includes developing a blockchain title recording system, However, the paper concludes that the costs are too high at the time being and further research is needed to actualize the goal of developing a blockchain system within the real estate industry.\n","source":"_posts/2018-05-03-best-practices-in-world-class-centers.md","raw":"title: Best Practices in World-Class Centers\n---\n## Best Practices in World-Class Centers\nIn order to maximize our excellence, it is vital to learn from the experiences of other centers around the world.

Centers</h2><p>In order to maximize our excellence, it is vital to learn from the experiences of other centers around the world. After extensively researching the different centers worldwide, we have concluded that there are three main centers that are renowned for their excellence and rigor in producing research on blockchain technology. These centers were chosen based on criteria that focused, firstly, on the universities and institutes that the centers are connected to, ensuring that only the highest ranking universities and institutes are considered. Thus, the UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies, and the MIT Digital Currency Initiative were chosen mainly because they are connected to world-class universities amongst the highest in world rankings. MIT is ranked as the top university in the world, and UCL is ranked 16thworldwide. The second criterion is the quality of the research produced, where all three centers were compared to other centers worldwide based on the research they publish and what was concluded was that these centers produced research of high quality, and have been running research projects for a longer time than other centers. Lastly, the final criterion is the relevance the centers have to the context of Dubai and to the goals and aims of YAP Centre. The IBM Center for Blockchain Innovation is relevant to the context of Dubai, as it has established collaborations with government authorities within Singapore, which is an essential aspect of the functioning of YAP Centre in Dubai. The research and collaboration examples provided by the 3 centers are a source of inspiration for YAP Centre, and provide a great example of best practices around the world.<br>This section will provide summaries of the top 3 centers that we have found to provide inspiration for our institute. Examples of research produced by the centers will also be included, to illustrate the relevance and rigor of their research.</p>\n<h3 id=\"UCL-Centre-for-Blockchain-Technologies-CBT-–-London-UK\"><a href=\"#UCL-Centre-for-Blockchain-Technologies-CBT-–-London-UK\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies (CBT) – London, UK\"></a>UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies (CBT) – London, UK</h3><p>Established in the prestigious campus of University College London (UCL), this center combines knowledge from 8 different departments within the university, including Mathematics, Psychology, and Law. This unique combination ensures that their research draws upon a diverse set of knowledge, acknowledging the complexity and multi-layered nature of blockchain technology. In addition to their research, they provide advisory services and engagement with various stakeholders, including regulators and the startup community. Moreover, the center has various partners within different industries, as a way to foster innovation and collaboration in order to achieve cutting-edge solutions. The following are two examples of their research projects and research papers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>RSCoin: This is a research project aimed at developed a cryptocurrency framework, which allows central banks to maintain full control over the monetary supply, as a way to prevent double-spending. What makes RSCoin unique is that it provides strong transparency and auditability, while maintaining a certain level of centralization</li>\n<li>Partnerships, Information and Public Safety: Community Policing in A Time of Terror: this research paper was authored by Christel Penella de Silva in 2017. The project aims to develop new methods and applications in space-time analytics and emergent network complexity, in order to uncover patterning and interactions in crime, policing and citizen perceptions.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"IBM-Center-for-Blockchain-Innovation-–-Singapore\"><a href=\"#IBM-Center-for-Blockchain-Innovation-–-Singapore\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"IBM Center for Blockchain Innovation – Singapore\"></a>IBM Center for Blockchain Innovation – Singapore</h3><p>This center is part of the larger IBM Research group, working in collaboration with three different government authorities in Singapore, including the Port Authority of Singapore, the Economic Development Board, and the Monetary Authority of Singapore. The focus of the center is to develop new applications and solutions utilizing blockchain technology. The work with government<br>authorities ensures that adoption of blockchain is accelerated within different areas of trade and finance. The center aims to make Singapore a global center of industry leadership in blockchain and cognitive technologies.</p>\n<h3 id=\"MIT-Digital-Currency-Initiative-–-Massachusetts-USA\"><a href=\"#MIT-Digital-Currency-Initiative-–-Massachusetts-USA\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"MIT Digital Currency Initiative – Massachusetts, USA\"></a>MIT Digital Currency Initiative – Massachusetts, USA</h3><p>This center is part of the larger MIT Media Lab, an interdisciplinary research laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The main mission of the group is to research cryptocurrency and the underlying technology, namely blockchain technology. Moreover, the research also explores the benefits, risks, and ethical considerations associated with blockchain technology. In addition to research, the MIT Digital Currency Initiative aims to support open-source cryptocurrency communities, while also fostering a diverse academic community in the field. Research from the center includes the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Blockchain Applications to Solar Panel Energy: Landscape Analysis. This research project addresses the energy needs of developing countries by providing a blockchain-enabled, collateralized solar micro-grid solution. The blockchain technology is used to record data, transfer energy and regulate digital-currency payments within the villages that were part of the project.</li>\n<li>Blockchain: Digitally Rebuilding the Real Estate Industry by Avi Spielman (2016). This research paper explores the application of blockchain technology in the real estate industry. This includes developing a blockchain title recording system, However, the paper concludes that the costs are too high at the time being and further research is needed to actualize the goal of developing a blockchain system within the real estate industry.</li>\n</ol>\n"}],"PostAsset":[],"PostCategory":[],"PostTag":[],"Tag":[]}}
