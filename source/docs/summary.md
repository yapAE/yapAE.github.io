## Summary
   Dubai YAP Centre for BlockChain Studies is a independent think-tank and research center licensed and recognized by Dubai Creative Clusters Authority,  UAE and having address: G11, Block 2, Dubai Knowledge Park, Dubai, UAE. Its research, consultancy and training programs concentrate on three areas: blockchain technologies, conventional economics industries, and social impact.

These nine tasks will be geared to meet the needs of government, investors, research institutes, banking, finance, insurance, legal firms, startups, tech corporation, consultancy, the creative economy, healthcare, tourism, supply chains.
In light of the Dubai Future Agenda established by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Dubai announced its intention to turn itself into the first blockchain-powered government in the world by 2020. These ambitions are part of Dubai's goal of becoming a global business hub with next-generation technology playing a key role in delivering this vision. The Dubai government also created the Global Blockchain Council with a specific focus on potential applications of blockchain technology, with the goal of highlighting how this technology could impact domestic financial and non-financial business sectors.
It is against this backdrop that we present ourselves as a neutral blockchain think tank providing research, training, and consultancy services to industry members, dedicated knowledge-transfer activities, and in-house cutting-edge solutions. We will work closely with several Dubai entities including trade, industry, tourism, education, health, as well as financial institutions and a vibrant startup community. In addition to this, we will be a base to deploy this new technology throughout the region.
The YAP Centre For Blockchain Studies(Dubai)’ (YAP Centre) functions will concentrate on three areas: blockchain technologies, conventional economics industries, and Islamic economics transactions. In each one of these three businesses, three main endeavors will be tackled: scientific research, capacity building, and consultancy. These nine tasks will be geared to meet the needs of government, investors, research institutes, banking, finance, insurance, legal firms, startups, tech corporation, consultancy, the creative economy, healthcare, tourism, supply chains, and more.
The first projects for the institute will focus on questions that were raised by Dubai’s vision of being the blockchain world center and the futuristic pioneer in the field. We will start with three distinct projects that represent the main fields of work for the institute:
• Research: Studying the potential of blockchain-based applications in different areas of society (government, finance, healthcare, etc.).
• Education: Summer and/or winter school program in blockchain. The Canadian University in Dubai will be the potential partner.
• Community: Multilateral Innovation Platform, designed around the industry and policymakers’ needs. An international conference on blockchain regulations that will bring together policymakers and world class experts in Dubai as a Capital of Islamic Economy.
We are driven by the spirit of Dubai as the lighthouse of the Muslim World in our endeavor to establish a center that brings the best of the East and the West, China, the Islamic world, and beyond. The YAP Centre For Blockchain Studies(Dubai) will be the first blockchain non-profit think tank.
