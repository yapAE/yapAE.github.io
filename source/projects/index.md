## Projects
The first projects for the YAP Centre For Blockchain Studies(Dubai) will focus on questions that were raised by Dubai’s vision of being the blockchain world center and the futuristic pioneer in the field. We will start with three distinct projects that represent the main fields of work for the center:
### Research: Studying the potential of blockchain-based applications in different areas of society (government, finance, healthcare, etc.) 
Examples:
 “End-to-end blockchain powered remittance services.”
 “Laws and regulations governing blockchain technology.”
 “Establishing a digital currency exchange (DCE).”
### Education: Summer and/or winter school program in blockchain. 
Example:
### Community: Multilateral Innovation Platform, designed around the industry and policymakers’ needs. 
Example:
 An international conference on blockchain regulations that will bring together
 policymakers and world class experts in Dubai as a Capital of Islamic Economy.
